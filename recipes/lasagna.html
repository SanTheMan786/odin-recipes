        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          Lasagna is a wide, flat sheet of pasta. Lasagna can refer to either
          the type of noodle or to the typical lasagna dish which is a dish made
          with several layers of lasagna sheets with sauce and other
          ingredients, such as meats and cheese, in between the lasagna noodles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Originally, the word lasagna was used to describe a pot in which food
          was being cooked rather than the pasta itself. Lasagna recipes have
          been around for ages, dating back to as early as the thirteenth
          century. Today, lasagnas come in all kinds of varieties from veggies
          and cream sauces to traditional sauce and cheese lasagnas as well as
          meat lasagnas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Originated in Italy during the middle ages, lasagna has been
          attributed to the city of Naples.

        <h3>Directions</h3>

            <p>
              In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over
              medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato
              paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel
              seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2
              tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours,
              stirring occasionally.
            </p>

              Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna
              noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and
              rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese
              with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p></li>
          <li>
            <p>
              To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a
              9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat
              sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top
              with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat
              sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
              Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan
              cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil
              with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the
              cheese.

            <p>
              Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an
              additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.
